	abstract = {Phylogenies are increasingly prominent across all of biology, especially as DNA sequencing makes more and more trees available. However, their utility is compromised by widespread misconceptions about what phylogenies can tell us, and improved ldquotree thinkingrdquo is crucial. The most-serious problem comes from reading trees as ladders from ldquoleft to rightrdquoÂ -Â many biologists assume that species-poor lineages that appear ldquoearly branchingrdquo or ldquobasalrdquo are ancestralÂ -Â we call this the ldquoprimitive lineage fallacyrdquo. This mistake causes misleading inferences about changes in individual characteristics and leads to misrepresentation of the evolutionary process. The problem can be rectified by considering that modern phylogenies of present-day species and genes show relationships among evolutionary cousins. Emphasizing that these are extant entities in the 21st century will help correct inferences about ancestral characteristics, and will enable us to leave behind 19th century notions about the ladder of progress driving evolution.

	abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment is a classical and challenging task. The problem is NP-hard. The full dynamic programming takes too much time. The progressive alignment heuristics adopted by most state-of-the-art works suffer from the "once a gap, always a gap" phenomenon. Is there a radically new way to do multiple sequence alignment? In this paper, we introduce a novel and orthogonal multiple sequence alignment method, using both multiple optimized spaced seeds and new algorithms to handle these seeds efficiently. Our new algorithm processes information of all sequences as a whole and tries to build the alignment vertically, avoiding problems caused by the popular progressive approaches. Because the optimized spaced seeds have proved significantly more sensitive than the consecutive k-mers, the new approach promises to be more accurate and reliable. To validate our new approach, we have implemented MANGO: Multiple Alignment with N Gapped Oligos. Experiments were carried out on large 16S RNA benchmarks, showing that MANGO compares favorably, in both accuracy and speed, against state-of-the-art multiple sequence alignment methods, including ClustalW 1.83, MUSCLE 3.6, MAFFT 5.861, ProbConsRNA 1.11, Dialign 2.2.1, DIALIGN-T 0.2.1, T-Coffee 4.85, POA 2.0, and Kalign 2.0. We have further demonstrated the scalability of MANGO on very large datasets of repeat elements. MANGO can be downloaded at http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/mango/ and is free for academic usage.},

Obtaining accurate alignments, however, is a difficult computational problem because of not only the high computational cost but also the lack of proper objective functions for measuring alignment quality. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic consistency, a novel scoring function for multiple sequence comparisons. We present ProbCons, a practical tool for progressive protein multiple sequence alignment based on probabilistic consistency, and evaluate its performance on several standard alignment benchmark data sets. On the BAliBASE, SABmark, and PREFAB benchmark alignment databases, ProbCons achieves statistically significant improvement over other leading methods while maintaining practical speed.

	abstract = {Detection of positive Darwinian selection has become ever more important with the rapid growth of genomic data sets. Recent branch-site models of codon substitution account for variation of selective pressure over branches on the tree and across sites in the sequence, and provide a means to detect short episodes of molecular adaptation affecting just a few sites. In likelihood ratio tests based on such models, the branches to be tested for positive selection have to be specified a priori. In the absence of a biological hypothesis to designate so-called foreground branches, one may test many branches, but a correction for multiple testing becomes necessary. In this paper, we employ computer simulation to evaluate the performance of six multiple-test correction procedures when the branch-site models are used to test every branch on the phylogeny for positive selection. Four of the methods control the family-wise error rates (FWER) while the other two control the false discovery rate (FDR). We found that all correction procedures achieved acceptable FWER except for extremely divergent sequences and serious model violations, when the test may become unreliable. The power of the test to detect positive selection is influenced by the strength of selection and the sequence divergence, with the highest power observed at intermediate divergences. The four correction procedures that control the FWER had similar power. We recommend Rom's procedure for its slightly higher power, but the simple Bonferroni correction is useable as well. The two correction procedures that control the FDR had slightly more power but also higher FWER. We demonstrate the multiple-test procedures by analyzing gene sequences from the extracellular domain of the cluster of differentiation 2 gene (CD2) from 10 mammalian species. Both our simulation and real data analysis suggest that the multiple-test procedures are useful when multiple branches have to be tested on the same data set.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals have provided insight into the dynamics of genome evolution, the genetic basis of differences between species, and the functions of individual genes. However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of âˆ¼16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible â€œselection historiesâ€? of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.},

	abstract = {The newly sequenced genome sequences of 11 Drosophila species provide the first opportunity to investigate variations in evolutionary rates across a clade of closely related species. Protein-coding genes were predicted using established Drosophila melanogaster genes as templates, with recovery rates ranging from 81\%97\% depending on species divergence and on genome assembly quality. Orthology and paralogy assignments were shown to be self-consistent among the different Drosophila species and to be consistent with regions of conserved gene order (synteny blocks). Next, we investigated the rates of diversification among these species' gene repertoires with respect to amino acid substitutions and to gene duplications. Constraints on amino acid sequences appear to have been most pronounced on D. ananassae and least pronounced on D. simulans and D. erecta terminal lineages. Codons predicted to have been subject to positive selection were found to be significantly over-represented among genes with roles in immune response and RNA metabolism, with the latter category including each subunit of the Dicer-2/r2d2 heterodimer. The vast majority of gene duplications (96.5\%) and synteny rearrangements were found to occur, as expected, within single Muller elements. We show that the rate of ancient gene duplications was relatively uniform. However, gene duplications in terminal lineages are strongly skewed toward very recent events, consistent with either a rapid-birth and rapid-death model or the presence of large proportions of copy number variable genes in these Drosophila populations. Duplications were significantly more frequent among trypsin-like proteases and DM8 putative lipid-binding domain proteins. 10.1101/gr.6249707},

	abstract = {For the [~]1\% of the human genome in the ENCODE regions, only about half of the transcriptionally active regions (TARs) identified with tiling microarrays correspond to annotated exons. Here we categorize this large amount of "unannotated transcription." We use a number of disparate features to classify the 6988 novel TARs--array expression profiles across cell lines and conditions, sequence composition, phylogenetic profiles (presence/absence of syntenic conservation across 17 species), and locations relative to genes. In the classification, we first filter out TARs with unusual sequence composition and those likely resulting from cross-hybridization. We then associate some of those remaining with proximal exons having correlated expression profiles. Finally, we cluster unclassified TARs into putative novel loci, based on similar expression and phylogenetic profiles. To encapsulate our classification, we construct a Database of Active Regions and Tools (DART.gersteinlab.org). DART has special facilities for rapidly handling and comparing many sets of TARs and their heterogeneous features, synchronizing across builds, and interfacing with other resources. Overall, we find that [~]14\% of the novel TARs can be associated with known genes, while [~]21\% can be clustered into [~]200 novel loci. We observe that TARs associated with genes are enriched in the potential to form structural RNAs and many novel TAR clusters are associated with nearby promoters. To benchmark our classification, we design a set of experiments for testing the connectivity of novel TARs. Overall, we find that 18 of the 46 connections tested validate by RT-PCR and four of five sequenced PCR products confirm connectivity unambiguously. 10.1101/gr.5696007},

The resulting time-dependent interaction network places both periodically and constitutively expressed proteins in a temporal cell cycle context, thereby revealing previously unknown components and modules. We discovered that most complexes consist of both periodically and constitutively expressed subunits, which suggests that the former control complex activity by a mechanism of just-in-time assembly. Consistent with this, we show that additional regulation through targeted degradation and phosphorylation by Cdc28p (Cdk1) specifically affects the periodically expressed proteins.},

	abstract = {Unraveling the evolutionary forces responsible for variations of neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47\%). This demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of GC-content. The evolution of GC-content correlates much more strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the neutral process of biased gene conversion (BGC) occurring within recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in the human genome. This model notably explains the positive correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate. Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore, recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots. This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions. We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and drift, BGC is one of the major factors driving genome evolution. Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density between human and chimp.},

We show theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic alignment problems.

We analyzed alignments of 7645 chimpanzee gene sequences to their human and mouse orthologs. These three-species sequence alignments allowed us to identify genes undergoing natural selection along the human and chimp lineage by fitting models that include parameters specifying rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution. This evolutionary approach revealed an informative set of genes with significantly different patterns of substitution on the human lineage compared with the chimpanzee and mouse lineages. Partitions of genes into inferred biological classes identified accelerated evolution in several functional classes, including olfaction and nuclear transport. In addition to suggesting adaptive physiological differences between chimps and humans, human-accelerated genes are significantly more likely to underlie major known Mendelian disorders.},

Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

	abstract = {Comparisons of the DNA sequences of metazoa show an excess of transitional over transversional substitutions. Part of this bias is due to the relatively high rate of mutation of methylated cytosines to thymine. Postmutation processes also introduce a bias, particularly selection for codon-usage bias in coding regions. It is generally assumed, however, that there is a universal bias in favour of transitions over transversions, possibly as a result of the underlying chemistry of mutation. Surprisingly, this underlying trend has been evaluated only in two types of metazoan, namely Drosophila and the Mammalia. Here, we investigate a third group, and find no such bias. We characterize the point substitution spectrum in Podisma pedestris, a grasshopper species with a very large genome. The accumulation of mutations was surveyed in two pseudogene families, nuclear mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA sequences. The cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides exhibit the high transition frequencies expected of methylated sites. The transition rate at other cytosine residues is significantly lower. After accounting for this methylation effect, there is no significant difference between transition and transversion rates. These results contrast with reports from other taxa and lead us to reject the hypothesis of a universal transition/transversion bias. Instead we suggest fundamental interspecific differences in point substitution processes.},

In particular, the statistical uncertainty within inferred alignments is often disregarded, while parametric or phylogenetic inferences are considered meaningless without confidence estimates. Here, we report on a theoretical and simulation study of pairwise alignments of genomic DNA at humanmouse divergence. We find that >15\% of aligned bases are incorrect in existing whole-genome alignments, and we identify three types of alignment error, each leading to systematic biases in all algorithms considered. Careful modeling of the evolutionary process improves alignment quality; however, these improvements are modest compared with the remaining alignment errors, even with exact knowledge of the evolutionary model, emphasizing the need for statistical approaches to account for uncertainty. We develop a new algorithm, Marginalized Posterior Decoding (MPD), which explicitly accounts for uncertainties, is less biased and more accurate than other algorithms we consider, and reduces the proportion of misaligned bases by a third compared with the best existing algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first nonheuristic algorithm for DNA sequence alignment to show robust improvements over the classic NeedlemanWunsch algorithm. Despite this, considerable uncertainty remains even in the improved alignments. We conclude that a probabilistic treatment is essential, both to improve alignment quality and to quantify the remaining uncertainty. This is becoming increasingly relevant with the growing appreciation of the importance of noncoding DNA, whose study relies heavily on alignments. Alignment errors are inevitable, and should be considered when drawing conclusions from alignments.

Several methods exist to detect the presence, and sometimes location, of positively selected sites in alignments of protein coding sequences. This paper describes the novel 'Sitewise Likelihood Ratio' (SLR) method for detecting non-neutral evolution, a statistical test that can identify sites that are unusually conserved as well as those that are unusually variable. We show that the SLR method can be more powerful than currently published methods for detecting the location of positive selection, especially in difficult cases where the strength of selection is low. The increase in power is achieved whilst relaxing assumptions about how the strength of selection varies over sites and without elevated rates of false positive results that have been reported with some other methods. We also show that the SLR method performs well even under circumstances where the results from some previous methods can be misleading.},

We used microarray analysis of RNA from different wild populations of house mouse subspecies (including Mus m. musculus, Mus m. domesticus, and Mus m. castaneus) and from the sister species Mus spretus to test this assumption. A comparison of expression divergence in brain, liver/kidney, and testis shows a major difference in the evolutionary dynamics of testis-related genes. While the comparison between species confirms an excess in divergence in testis genes, we find that all comparisons between subspecies yield only a very small number of genes with significantly different expression levels in the testis. These results suggest that the early phase of the speciation process may not be driven by regulatory changes in genes that are potential targets of sexual selection, and that the divergence in these genes is only established during a later phase of the speciation process. 10.1101/gr.5683806},

	abstract = {Differences in gene expression are an important source of phenotypic variation, and can be caused by changes in cis and/or trans regulation. cis-regulatory variants alter allele-specific expression, whereas trans-regulatory variants influence expression of both alleles in a diploid cell. Because of this difference, we hypothesize that natural selection may favor one type of change over the other. Here, we investigate contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory changes to variable intra- and interspecific gene expression using four strains of Drosophila melanogaster, three strains of D. simulans and a total of 78 genes. We show that cis-regulatory changes account for a greater proportion of the expression differences observed between rather than within species. These data are inconsistent with a neutral model assuming equal probabilities of fixation for cis- and trans-regulatory polymorphisms, suggesting that natural selection influences the molecular mechanisms underlying divergent gene expression. Specifically, cis-regulatory changes seem to accumulate preferentially over time.},

	abstract = {It is possible to estimate the proportion of substitutions that are due to adaptive evolution using the numbers of silent and nonsilent polymorphisms and substitutions in a McDonald and Kreitman-type analysis. Unfortunately, this estimate of adaptive evolution is biased downward by the segregation of slightly deleterious mutations. It has been suggested that 1 way to cope with the effects of these slightly deleterious mutations is to remove low-frequency polymorphisms from the analysis. We investigate the performance of this method theoretically. We show that although removing low-frequency polymorphisms does indeed reduce the bias in the estimate of adaptive evolution, the estimate is always downwardly biased, often to the extent that one would not be able to detect adaptive evolution, even if it existed. The method is reasonably satisfactory, only if the rate of adaptive evolution is high and the distribution of fitness effects for slightly deleterious mutations is very leptokurtic. Our analysis suggests that adaptive evolution could be quite prevalent in humans (>8\%) and still not be detectable using current methodologies. Our analysis also suggests that the level of adaptive evolution has probably been underestimated, possibly substantially, in both bacteria and Drosophila. 10.1093/molbev/msn005},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) contributes to increased transcriptome and proteome diversity in various eukaryotic lineages. Previous studies showed low levels of conservation of alternatively spliced (cassette) exons within mammals and within dipterans. We report a strikingly different pattern in Caenorhabditis nematodes--more than 92\% of cassette exons from Caenorhabditis elegans are conserved in Caenorhabditis briggsae and/or Caenorhabditis remanei. High levels of conservation extend to minor-form exons (present in a minority of transcripts) and are particularly pronounced for exons showing complex patterns of splicing. The functionality of the vast majority of cassette exons is underscored by various other features. We suggest that differences in conservation between lineages reflect differences in levels of functionality and further suggest that these differences are due to differences in intron length and the strength of consensus boundaries across lineages. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse relationship between AS and gene duplication, suggesting that the latter may be primarily responsible for the emergence of new functional transcripts in nematodes. 10.1093/molbev/msm262},

Implicit in these advances is a great deal of information about the structure and evolution of surrounding sequences. Here, we review the wealth of ways in which structures of spliceosomal introns as well as their conservation and change through evolution may be harnessed for evolutionary and genomic analysis. First, we discuss uses of intron length distributions and positions in sequence assembly and annotation, and for improving alignment of homologous regions. Second, we review uses of introns in evolutionary studies, including the utility of introns as indicators of rates of sequence evolution, for inferences about molecular evolution, as signatures of orthology and paralogy, and for estimating rates of nucleotide substitution.

	abstract = {Summary. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 3\% of the world population. The chronicity of hepatitis C seems to depend on the level of genetic variability. We have recently (Torres-Puente et al., J Viral Hepat, 2008; 15: 188) reported genetic variability estimates from a large-scale sequence analysis of 67 patients infected with HCV subtypes 1a (23 patients) and 1b (44 patients) and related them to response, or lack of, to alpha-interferon plus ribavirin treatment.. Two HCV genome regions were analysed in samples prior to antiviral therapy, one compressing the three hypervariable regions of the E2 glycoprotein and another one including the interferon sensitive determining region and the V3 domain of the NS5A protein. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity measures showed a clear tendency to higher genetic variability levels in nonresponder than in responder patients. Here, we have refined the analysis of genetic variability (haplotype and nucleotide diversity, number of haplotypes and mutations) by considering their distribution in each of the biologically meaningful subregions mentioned above, as well as in their surrounding and intervening regions. Variability levels are very heterogeneous among the different subregions, being higher for nonresponder patients. Interestingly, significant differences were detected in the biologically relevant regions, but also in the surrounding regions, suggesting that the level of variability of the whole HCV genome, rather than exclusively that from the hypervariable regions, is the main indicator of the treatment response. Finally, the number of haplotypes and mutations seem to be better discriminators than haplotype and nucleotide diversity, especially in the NS5A region.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism affording extensive proteomic and regulatory diversity from a limited repertoire of genes. However, the extent to which alternative splicing has contributed to the evolution of primate species-specific characteristics has not been assessed previously. Using comparative genomics and quantitative microarray profiling, we performed the first global analysis of alternative splicing differences between humans and chimpanzees. Surprisingly, 6\%8\% of profiled orthologous exons display pronounced splicing level differences in the corresponding tissues from the two species. Little overlap is observed between the genes associated with alternative splicing differences and the genes that display steady-state transcript level differences, indicating that these layers of regulation have evolved rapidly to affect distinct subsets of genes in humans and chimpanzees. The alternative splicing differences we detected are predicted to affect diverse functions including gene expression, signal transduction, cell death, immune defense, and susceptibility to diseases. Differences in expression at the protein level of the major splice variant of Glutathione S-transferase omega-2 (GSTO2), which functions in the protection against oxidative stress and is associated with human aging-related diseases, suggests that this enzyme is less active in human cells compared with chimpanzee cells. The results of this study thus support an important role for alternative splicing in establishing differences between humans and chimpanzees. 10.1101/gad.1606907},

	abstract = {Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process in which the copy of a gene inherited from one parent (maternal or paternal) is consistently silenced or expressed at a significantly lower level than the copy from the other parent. In an effort to begin a systematic genome-wide screen for imprinted genes, we assayed differential allelic expression (DAE) at 3,877 bi-allelic protein-coding sites located in 2,625 human genes in 67 unrelated individuals using genotyping microarrays. We used the presence of both over- and under-expression of the reference allele compared to the alternate allele to identify candidate-imprinted genes. We found 61 genes with at least twofold DAE plus "flipping" of the more highly expressed allele between reference and alternate across heterozygous samples. Sixteen flipping genes were genotyped and assayed for DAE in an independent data set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from two CEPH pedigrees. We confirmed that PEG10 is paternally expressed, identified one gene (ZNF331) with multiple lines of data indicating it is imprinted, and predicted several additional imprinting candidate genes. Our findings suggest that there are at most several hundred genes in the human genome that are universally imprinted. With samples of mRNA from appropriate tissues and a collection of informative cSNPs, a genome-wide search using this methodology could expand the list of genes that undergo genomic imprinting in a tissue- or temporal-specific manner.},

	abstract = {Accurate identification of the transmitted virus and sequences evolving from it could be instrumental in elucidating the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and in developing vaccines, drugs, or microbicides to prevent infection. Here we describe an experimental approach to analyze HIV-1 env genes as intact genetic units amplified from plasma virion RNA by single-genome amplification (SGA), followed by direct sequencing of uncloned DNA amplicons. We show that this strategy precludes in vitro artifacts caused by Taq-induced nucleotide substitutions and template switching, provides an accurate representation of the env quasispecies in vivo, and has an overall error rate (including nucleotide misincorporation, insertion, and deletion) of less than 8 x 10-5. Applying this method to the analysis of virus in plasma from 12 Zambian subjects from whom samples were obtained within 3 months of seroconversion, we show that transmitted or early founder viruses can be identified and that molecular pathways and rates of early env diversification can be defined. Specifically, we show that 8 of the 12 subjects were each infected by a single virus, while 4 others acquired more than one virus; that the rate of virus evolution in one subject during an 80-day period spanning seroconversion was 1.7 x 10-5 substitutions per site per day; and that evidence of strong immunologic selection can be seen in Env and overlapping Rev sequences based on nonrandom accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations. We also compared the results of the SGA approach with those of more-conventional bulk PCR amplification methods performed on the same patient samples and found that the latter is associated with excessive rates of Taq-induced recombination, nucleotide misincorporation, template resampling, and cloning bias. These findings indicate that HIV-1 env genes, other viral genes, and even full-length viral genomes responsible for productive clinical infection can be identified by SGA analysis of plasma virus sampled at intervals typical in large-scale vaccine trials and that pathways of viral diversification and immune escape can be determined accurately. 10.1128/JVI.02660-07},

	abstract = {Cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) is a high-throughput, tag-based method designed to survey the 5' end of capped full-length cDNAs. CAGE has previously been used to define global transcription start site usage and monitor gene activity in mammals. A drawback of the CAGE approach thus far has been the removal of as many as 40\% of CAGE sequence tags due to their mapping to multiple genomic locations. Here, we address the origins of multimap tags and present a novel strategy to assign CAGE tags to their most likely source promoter region. When this approach was applied to the FANTOM3 CAGE libraries, the percentage of protein-coding mouse transcriptional frameworks detected by CAGE improved from 42.9 to 57.8\% (an increase of 5516 frameworks) with no reduction in CAGE to microarray correlation. These results suggest that the multimap tags produced by high-throughput, short sequence tag-based approaches can be rescued to augment greatly the transcriptome coverage provided by single-map tags alone.},

	abstract = {BIOLOGY IS ENCODED IN MOLECULAR SEQUENCES: deciphering this encoding remains a grand scientific challenge. Functional regions of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences often exhibit characteristic but subtle motifs; thus, computational discovery of motifs in sequences is a fundamental and much-studied problem. However, most current algorithms do not allow for insertions or deletions (indels) within motifs, and the few that do have other limitations. We present a method, GLAM2 (Gapped Local Alignment of Motifs), for discovering motifs allowing indels in a fully general manner, and a companion method GLAM2SCAN for searching sequence databases using such motifs. glam2 is a generalization of the gapless Gibbs sampling algorithm. It re-discovers variable-width protein motifs from the PROSITE database significantly more accurately than the alternative methods PRATT and SAM-T2K. Furthermore, it usefully refines protein motifs from the ELM database: in some cases, the refined motifs make orders of magnitude fewer overpredictions than the original ELM regular expressions. GLAM2 performs respectably on the BAliBASE multiple alignment benchmark, and may be superior to leading multiple alignment methods for "motif-like" alignments with N- and C-terminal extensions. Finally, we demonstrate the use of GLAM2 to discover protein kinase substrate motifs and a gapped DNA motif for the LIM-only transcriptional regulatory complex: using GLAM2SCAN, we identify promising targets for the latter. GLAM2 is especially promising for short protein motifs, and it should improve our ability to identify the protein cleavage sites, interaction sites, post-translational modification attachment sites, etc., that underlie much of biology. It may be equally useful for arbitrarily gapped motifs in DNA and RNA, although fewer examples of such motifs are known at present.

The predictions are therefore highly sensitive to alignment errors or regions of alignment uncertainty. Alternatively, statistical alignment methods provide a framework for performing phylogenetic analyses by examining a distribution of alignments. RESULTS: We developed a novel algorithm for predicting functional elements by combining statistical alignment and phylogenetic footprinting (SAPF). SAPF simultaneously performs both alignment and annotation by combining phylogenetic footprinting techniques with an HMM transducer-based multiple alignment model, and can analyze sequence data from multiple sequences. We assessed SAPF's predictive performance on two simulated datasets and three well-annotated cis-regulatory modules from newly sequenced Drosophila genomes. The results demonstrate that removing the traditional dependence on a single alignment can significantly augment the predictive performance, especially when there is uncertainty in the alignment of functional regions.

In addition to prokaryotic orthology, delineating eukaryotic orthology has provided insight into the evolution of higher organisms. Indeed, many eukaryotic ortholog databases have been established for this purpose. However, unlike prokaryotes, alternative splicing (AS) has hampered eukaryotic orthology assignments. Therefore, existing databases likely contain ambiguous eukaryotic ortholog relationships and possibly misclassify alternatively spliced protein isoforms as in-paralogs, which are duplicated genes that arise following speciation. Here, we propose a new approach for designating eukaryotic orthology using processed transcription units, and we present an orthology database prototype using the human and mouse genomes. Currently existing programs cover less than 69\% of the human reference sequences when assigning human/mouse orthologs. In contrast, our method encompasses up to 80\% of the human reference sequences. Moreover, the ortholog database presented herein is more than 92\% consistent with the existing databases. In addition to managing AS, this approach is capable of identifying orthologs of embedded genes and fusion genes using syntenic evidence. In summary, this new approach is sensitive, specific and can generate a more comprehensive and accurate compilation of eukaryotic orthologs.},

In the previous studies, weak positive or negative correlations have been found between the silent-site guanine and cytosine (GC) content and expression of mammalian genes. However, previous studies disregarded differences in the genomic context of genes, which could potentially obscure any correlation between GC content and expression. In the present work, we directly compared the expression of GC-rich and GC-poor genes placed in the context of identical promoters and UTR sequences. We performed transient and stable transfections of mammalian cells with GC-rich and GC-poor versions of Hsp70, green fluorescent protein, and IL2 genes. The GC-rich genes were expressed several-fold to over a 100-fold more efficiently than their GC-poor counterparts. This effect was not due to different translation rates of GC-rich and GC-poor mRNA. On the contrary, the efficient expression of GC-rich genes resulted from their increased steady-state mRNA levels. mRNA degradation rates were not correlated with GC content, suggesting that efficient transcription or mRNA processing is responsible for the high expression of GC-rich genes. We conclude that silent-site GC content correlates with gene expression efficiency in mammalian cells.},

Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and Muller. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Functional divergence among proteins is often assumed to be strongly influenced by natural selection, as inferred from the ratio of nonsynonymous nucleotide divergence (d(N)) to synonymous nucleotide divergence (d(S)). That is, the more a mutation changes protein function, the more likely it is to be either selected against or selectively favored, and because the d(N)/d(S) ratio is a measure of natural selection, this ratio can be used to predict the degree of functional divergence (d(F)). However, these hypotheses have rarely been experimentally tested. RESULTS: I present a novel method to address this issue, and demonstrate that divergence in bacteria-killing activity among animal antimicrobial peptides is positively correlated with the log of the d(N)/d(S) ratio. The primary cause of this pattern appears to be that positively selected substitutions change protein function more than neutral substitutions do. Thus, the d(N)/d(S) ratio is an accurate estimator of adaptive functional divergence.

	abstract = {The polyhomeotic (ph) locus in Drosophila melanogaster consists of the two tandemly duplicated genes ph-d (distal) and ph-p (proximal). They code for transcriptional repressors belonging to the Polycomb group proteins, which regulate homeotic genes and hundreds of other loci. Although the duplication of ph occurred at least 25 million to 30 million years ago, both copies are very similar to each other at both the DNA and the protein levels, probably because of the action of frequent gene conversion. Despite this homogenizing force, differential regulation of both transcriptional units suggests that the functions of the duplicates have begun to diverge. Here, we provide evidence that this functional divergence is driven by positive selection. Based on resequencing of an {approx}30-kb region around the ph locus in an African sample of D. melanogaster X chromosomes, we identified a selective sweep, estimated its age and the strength of selection, and mapped the target of selection to a narrow interval of the ph-p gene. This noncoding region contains a large intron with several regulatory elements that are absent in the ph-d duplicate. Our results suggest that neofunctionalization has been achieved in the Drosophila ph genes through the action of strong positive selection and the inactivation of gene conversion in part of the gene. 10.1073/pnas.0710892105},

RESULTS: We present a graph representation of an MSA that can itself be aligned directly by pairwise dynamic programming, eliminating the need to reduce the MSA to a profile. This enables our algorithm (Partial Order Alignment (POA)) to guarantee that the optimal alignment of each new sequence versus each sequence in the MSA will be considered. Moreover, this algorithm introduces a new edit operator, homologous recombination, important for multidomain sequences. The algorithm has improved speed (linear time complexity) over existing MSA algorithms, enabling construction of massive and complex alignments (e.g. an alignment of 5000 sequences in 4 h on a Pentium II). We demonstrate the utility of this algorithm on a family of multidomain SH2 proteins, and on EST assemblies containing alternative splicing and polymorphism.

The recent divergence and associated overall sequence conservation between individual members of this taxon have nonetheless largely precluded the use of primates in comparative sequence studies. We used sequence comparisons of an extensive set of Old World and New World monkeys and hominoids to identify functional regions in the human genome. Analysis of these data enabled the discovery of primate-specific gene regulatory elements and the demarcation of the exons of multiple genes. Much of the information content of the comprehensive primate sequence comparisons could be captured with a small subset of phylogenetically close primates. These results demonstrate the utility of intraprimate sequence comparisons to discover common mammalian as well as primate-specific functional elements in the human genome, which are unattainable through the evaluation of more evolutionarily distant species.},

CNEs seem to be largely unique, with no large families of similar elements reported to date. Here, we search for CNEs among the ancestral repeat classes in the human genome and report the discovery of a large CNE family containing >900 members. This family belongs to the MER121 class of repeats. Although the MER121 family members show considerable sequence variation among one another, the individual copies show striking conservation in orthologous locations across the human, dog, mouse, and rat genomes. The element is also present and conserved in orthologous locations in the marsupial, but its genome-wide dispersal postdates the divergence from birds. The comparative genomic data indicate that MER121 does not encode a family of either protein-coding or RNA genes. Although the precise function of these elements remains unknown, the evidence suggests that this unusual family may play a cis-regulatory or structural role in mammalian genomes.},

	abstract = {A key component of the ongoing ENCODE project involves rigorous comparative sequence analyses for the initially targeted 1\% of the human genome. Here, we present orthologous sequence generation, alignment, and evolutionary constraint analyses of 23 mammalian species for all ENCODE targets. Alignments were generated using four different methods; comparisons of these methods reveal large-scale consistency but substantial differences in terms of small genomic rearrangements, sensitivity (sequence coverage), and specificity (alignment accuracy). We describe the quantitative and qualitative trade-offs concomitant with alignment method choice and the levels of technical error that need to be accounted for in applications that require multisequence alignments. Using the generated alignments, we identified constrained regions using three different methods. While the different constraint-detecting methods are in general agreement, there are important discrepancies relating to both the underlying alignments and the specific algorithms. However, by integrating the results across the alignments and constraint-detecting methods, we produced constraint annotations that were found to be robust based on multiple independent measures. Analyses of these annotations illustrate that most classes of experimentally annotated functional elements are enriched for constrained sequences; however, large portions of each class (with the exception of protein-coding sequences) do not overlap constrained regions. The latter elements might not be under primary sequence constraint, might not be constrained across all mammals, or might have expendable molecular functions. Conversely, 40\% of the constrained sequences do not overlap any of the functional elements that have been experimentally identified. Together, these findings demonstrate and quantify how many genomic functional elements await basic molecular characterization. 10.1101/gr.6034307},

@article{citeulike:783758,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous tools have been developed to align genomic sequences. However, their relative performance in specific applications remains poorly characterized. Alignments of protein-coding sequences typically have been benchmarked against "correct" alignments inferred from structural data. For noncoding sequences, where such independent validation is lacking, simulation provides an effective means to generate "correct" alignments with which to benchmark alignment tools. RESULTS: Using rates of noncoding sequence evolution estimated from the genus Drosophila, we simulated alignments over a range of divergence times under varying models incorporating point substitution, insertion/deletion events, and short blocks of constrained sequences such as those found in cis-regulatory regions. We then compared "correct" alignments generated by a modified version of the ROSE simulation platform to alignments of the simulated derived sequences produced by eight pairwise alignment tools (Avid, BlastZ, Chaos, ClustalW, DiAlign, Lagan, Needle, and WABA) to determine the off-the-shelf performance of each tool. As expected, the ability to align noncoding sequences accurately decreases with increasing divergence for all tools, and declines faster in the presence of insertion/deletion evolution. Global alignment tools (Avid, ClustalW, Lagan, and Needle) typically have higher sensitivity over entire noncoding sequences as well as in constrained sequences. Local tools (BlastZ, Chaos, and WABA) have lower overall sensitivity as a consequence of incomplete coverage, but have high specificity to detect constrained sequences as well as high sensitivity within the subset of sequences they align. Tools such as DiAlign, which generate both local and global outputs, produce alignments of constrained sequences with both high sensitivity and specificity for divergence distances in the range of 1.25-3.0 substitutions per site. CONCLUSION: For species with genomic properties similar to Drosophila, we conclude that a single pair of optimally diverged species analyzed with a high performance alignment tool can yield accurate and specific alignments of functionally constrained noncoding sequences. Further algorithm development, optimization of alignment parameters, and benchmarking studies will be necessary to extract the maximal biological information from alignments of functional noncoding DNA.},

We conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression. RESULTS: To obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mRNA expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62 839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. Indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index tau, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15< tau<0.85 were found to constitute >50\% of all expression patterns. We developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the I(B) tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12-I(B) tissues in which it shows low expression. The 85 dominant midrange patterns with I(B)=2-11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. Our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. Such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. These findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.

In most vertebrates a single PAX6 gene encodes a transcription factor required for eye, brain, olfactory system, and pancreas development. In zebrafish, following a postulated whole-genome duplication event in an ancestral teleost, duplicates pax6a and pax6b jointly fulfill these roles. Mapping of the homozygously viable eye mutant sunrise identified a homeodomain missense change in pax6b, leading to loss of target binding. The mild phenotype emphasizes role-sharing between the co-orthologues. Meticulous mapping of isolated BACs identified perturbed synteny relationships around the duplicates. This highlights the functional conservation of pax6 downstream (3\&\#8242;) control sequences, which in most vertebrates reside within the introns of a ubiquitously expressed neighbour gene, ELP4, whose pax6a-linked exons have been lost in zebrafish. Reporter transgenic studies in both mouse and zebrafish, combined with analysis of vertebrate sequence conservation, reveal loss and retention of specific cis-regulatory elements, correlating strongly with the diverged expression of co-orthologues, and providing clear evidence for evolution by subfunctionalization.},

	abstract = {1. A detailed compartmental model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell with active dendritic membrane was constructed. The model was based on anatomic reconstructions of single Purkinje cells and included 10 different types of voltage-dependent channels described by Hodgkin-Huxley equations, derived from Purkinje cell-specific voltage-clamp data where available. These channels included a fast and persistent Na+ channel, three voltage-dependent K+ channels, T-type and P-type Ca2+ channels, and two types of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. 2. The ionic channels were distributed differentially over three zones of the model, with Na+ channels in the soma, fast K+ channels in the soma and main dendrite, and Ca2+ channels and Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels in the entire dendrite. Channel densities in the model were varied until it could reproduce Purkinje cell responses to current injections in the soma or dendrite, as observed in slice recordings. 3. As in real Purkinje cells, the model generated two types of spiking behavior. In response to small current injections the model fired exclusively fast somatic spikes. These somatic spikes were caused by Na+ channels and repolarized by the delayed rectifier. When higher-amplitude current injections were given, sodium spiking increased in frequency until the model generated large dendritic Ca2+ spikes. Analysis of membrane currents underlying this behavior showed that these Ca2+ spikes were caused by the P-type Ca2+ channel and repolarized by the BK-type Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel. As in pharmacological blocking experiments, removal of Na+ channels abolished the fast spikes and removal of Ca2+ channels removed Ca2+ spiking. 4. In addition to spiking behavior, the model also produced slow plateau potentials in both the dendrite and soma. These longer-duration potentials occurred in response to both short and prolonged current steps. Analysis of the model demonstrated that the plateau potentials in the soma were caused by the window current component of the fast Na+ current, which was much larger than the current through the persistent Na+ channels. Plateau potentials in the dendrite were carried by the same P-type Ca2+ channel that was also responsible for Ca2+ spike generation. The P channel could participate in both model functions because of the low-threshold K2-type Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel, which dynamically changed the threshold for dendritic spike generation through a negative feedback loop with the activation kinetics of the P-type Ca2+ channel. 5. These model responses were robust to changes in the densities of all of the ionic channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {1. Both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic channels were added to a previously described complex compartmental model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell to examine model responses to synaptic inputs. All model parameters remained as described previously, leaving maximum synaptic conductance as the only parameter that was tuned in the studies described in this paper. Under these conditions the model was capable of reproducing physiological recorded responses to each of the major types of synaptic input. 2. When excitatory synapses were activated on the smooth dendrites of the model, the model generated a complex dendritic Ca2+ spike similar to that generated by climbing fiber inputs. Examination of the model showed that activation of P-type Ca2+ channels in both the smooth and spiny dendrites augmented the depolarization during the complex spike and that Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels in the same dendritic regions determined the duration of the spike. When these synapses were activated under simulated current-clamp conditions the model also generated the characteristic dual reversal potential of the complex spike. The shape of the dendritic complex spike could be altered by changing the maximum conductance of the climbing fiber synapse and thus the amount of Ca2+ entering the cell. 3. To explore the background simple spike firing properties of Purkinje cells in vivo we added excitatory "parallel fiber" synapses to the spiny dendritic branches of the model. Continuous asynchronous activation of these granule cell synapses resulted in the generation of spontaneous sodium spikes. However, very low asynchronous input frequencies produced a highly regular, very fast rhythm (80-120 Hz), whereas slightly higher input frequencies resulted in Purkinje cell bursting. Both types of activity are uncharacteristic of in vivo Purkinje cell recordings. 4. Inhibitory synapses of the sort presumably generated by stellate cells were also added to the dendritic tree. When asynchronous activation of these inhibitory synapses was combined with continuous asynchronous excitatory input the model generated somatic action potentials in a much more stochastic pattern typical of real Purkinje cells. Under these conditions simulated inter-spike interval distributions resembled those found in experimental recordings. Also, as with in vivo recordings, the model did not generate dendritic bursts. This was mainly due to inhibition that suppressed the generation of dendritic Ca2+ spikes. 5. In the presence of asynchronous inhibition, changes in the average frequency of excitatory inputs modulated background simple spike firing frequencies in the natural range of Purkinje cell firing frequencies (30-100 Hz). This modulation was very sensitive to small changes in the average frequency of excitatory inputs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The mutational event is not observed directly, but is inferred from the phenotype of the original mutant or of its descendants; the rate of mutation is inferred from the number of such mutant phenotypes. Such inference presumes a knowledge of the probability distribution for the size of a clone arising from a single mutation. We develop a mathematical formulation that assists in the design and analysis of experiments which investigate mutation rates and mutant clone size distribution, and we use it to analyse data for which the classical Luria-Delbruck clone-size distribution must be rejected.},

	abstract = {Change of DNA sequence that fuels evolution is, to a certain extent, a deterministic process because mutagenesis does not occur in an absolutely random manner. So far, it has not been possible to decipher the rules that govern DNA sequence evolution due to the extreme complexity of the entire process. In our attempt to approach this issue we focus solely on the mechanisms of mutagenesis and deliberately disregard the role of natural selection. Hence, in this analysis, evolution refers to the accumulation of genetic alterations that originate from mutations and are transmitted through generations without being subjected to natural selection. We have developed a software tool that allows modelling of a DNA sequence as a one-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) with four states per cell which correspond to the four DNA bases, i.e. A, C, T and G. The four states are represented by numbers of the quaternary number system. Moreover, we have developed genetic algorithms (GAs) in order to determine the rules of CA evolution that simulate the DNA evolution process. Linear evolution rules were considered and square matrices were used to represent them. If DNA sequences of different evolution steps are available, our approach allows the determination of the underlying evolution rule(s). Conversely, once the evolution rules are deciphered, our tool may reconstruct the DNA sequence in any previous evolution step for which the exact sequence information was unknown. The developed tool may be used to test various parameters that could influence evolution. We describe a paradigm relying on the assumption that mutagenesis is governed by a near-neighbour-dependent mechanism. Based on the satisfactory performance of our system in the deliberately simplified example, we propose that our approach could offer a starting point for future attempts to understand the mechanisms that govern evolution. The developed software is open-source and has a user-friendly graphical input interface.},

	abstract = {Nucleotide insertion and deletion (indel) events, together with substitutions, represent the major mutational processes of gene evolution. Through the alignment of 8148 orthologous genes from human, mouse, and rat, we have identified 1743 indel events within rodent protein-coding sequences. Using human as an out-group, we reconstructed the mutational event underlying each of these indels. Overall, we found an excess of deletions over insertions, particularly for the rat lineage (70\% excess). Sequence slippage accounts for at least 52\% of insertions and 38\% of deletions. We have also evaluated the selective tolerance of identifiable protein structures to indels. Transmembrane domains are the least, and low complexity regions, the most tolerant. Mapping of indels onto known protein structures demonstrated that structural cores are markedly less tolerant to indels than are loop regions. There is a specific enrichment of CpG dinucleotides in close proximity to insertion events, and both insertions and deletions are more common in higher G+C content sequences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large-scale quantitative analysis of transcriptional co-expression has been used to dissect regulatory networks and to predict the functions of new genes discovered by genome sequencing in model organisms such as yeast. Although the idea that tissue-specific expression is indicative of gene function in mammals is widely accepted, it has not been objectively tested nor compared with the related but distinct strategy of correlating gene co-expression as a means to predict gene function. RESULTS: We generated microarray expression data for nearly 40,000 known and predicted mRNAs in 55 mouse tissues, using custom-built oligonucleotide arrays. We show that quantitative transcriptional co-expression is a powerful predictor of gene function. Hundreds of functional categories, as defined by Gene Ontology 'Biological Processes', are associated with characteristic expression patterns across all tissues, including categories that bear no overt relationship to the tissue of origin. In contrast, simple tissue-specific restriction of expression is a poor predictor of which genes are in which functional categories. As an example, the highly conserved mouse gene PWP1 is widely expressed across different tissues but is co-expressed with many RNA-processing genes; we show that the uncharacterized yeast homolog of PWP1 is required for rRNA biogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 'functional genomics' strategies based on quantitative transcriptional co-expression will be as fruitful in mammals as they have been in simpler organisms, and that transcriptional control of mammalian physiology is more modular than is generally appreciated. Our data and analyses provide a public resource for mammalian functional genomics.},

	abstract = {Ultraconserved elements have been suggested to retain extended perfect sequence identity between the human, mouse, and rat genomes due to essential functional properties. To investigate the necessities of these elements in vivo, we removed four noncoding ultraconserved elements (ranging in length from 222 to 731 base pairs) from the mouse genome. To maximize the likelihood of observing a phenotype, we chose to delete elements that function as enhancers in a mouse transgenic assay and that are near genes that exhibit marked phenotypes both when completely inactivated in the mouse and when their expression is altered due to other genomic modifications. Remarkably, all four resulting lines of mice lacking these ultraconserved elements were viable and fertile, and failed to reveal any critical abnormalities when assayed for a variety of phenotypes including growth, longevity, pathology, and metabolism. In addition, more targeted screens, informed by the abnormalities observed in mice in which genes in proximity to the investigated elements had been altered, also failed to reveal notable abnormalities. These results, while not inclusive of all the possible phenotypic impact of the deleted sequences, indicate that extreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucial functions required for viability.},

	abstract = {FBN1, the gene mutated in Marfan syndrome, encodes fibrillin-1, a large glycoprotein component of the extracellular microfibrils. Human FBN1 has three untranslated upstream exons, and homologous sequences can be identified in a number of mammalian species. In this work, we have used functional assays to characterize the FBN1 upstream region. Sequences upstream of exon 1 and at least two of the upstream untranslated exons were shown to possess promoter activity in vitro. The strongest activity in luciferase assays was shown for sequences upstream of the untranslated exon A. Sequence analysis of the sequences in and upstream of exon A in humans and six other mammalian species demonstrated several highly conserved potential cis-acting sequences as well as a 66-basepair (bp) ultraconserved sequence with nearly perfect conservation in the seven species. The ultraconserved sequence contains an initiator element (Inr), a downstream promoter element (DPE), and a 10-bp palindromic element. Mutational assays showed that both the Inr and the DPE are critical for full promoter activity. A mutation of the 10-bp palindromic element completely abolished basal promoter activity. The element was shown to bind specifically to an unknown nuclear protein by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Ultraconservation within an alternate promoter has not been previously reported. We suggest that the ultraconservation may reflect the importance of finely tuned regulation of alternate transcription of FBN1 and that the sequences involved have been under negative selective pressure for at least the last 180 million years of mammalian evolution.},

This article illustrates the power of this resource for exploring vertebrate and mammalian evolution, using three examples. First, we present several vignettes involving insertions and deletions within protein-coding regions, including a look at some human-specific indels. Then we study the extent to which start codons and stop codons in the human sequence are conserved in other species, showing that start codons are in general more poorly conserved than stop codons. Finally, an investigation of the phylogenetic depth of conservation for several classes of functional elements in the human genome reveals striking differences in the rates and modes of decay in alignability. Each functional class has a distinctive period of stringent constraint, followed by decays that allow (for the case of regulatory regions) or reject (for coding regions and ultraconserved elements) insertions and deletions. 10.1101/gr.6761107},

To determine whether polymorphisms in ultraconserved elements affect fitness, we genotyped unrelated human DNA samples at loci within these sequences. For all single-nucleotide polymorphisms tested in ultraconserved regions, individuals homozygous for derived alleles (alleles that differ from the rodent reference genomes) were present, viable, and healthy. The distribution of allele frequencies in these samples argues against strong, ongoing selection as the force maintaining the conservation of these sequences. We then used two methods to determine the minimum level of selection required to generate these sequences. Despite the lack of fixed differences in these sequences between humans and rodents, the average level of selection on ultraconserved elements is less than that on essential genes. The strength of selection associated with ultraconserved elements suggests that mutations in these regions may have subtle phenotypic consequences that are not easily detected in the laboratory.},

The local GC-content is decaying towards an equilibrium point, but the causes and rates of this decay, as well as the value of the equilibrium point, remain topics of debate. By comparing the results of two methods for estimating local substitution rates we identify 620 Mb of the human genome in which the rates of the various types of nucleotide substitutions are the same on both strands. These strand-symmetric regions show an exponential decay of local GC-content at a pace determined by local substitution rates. DNA segments subjected to higher rates experience disproportionately accelerated decay and are AT-rich, whereas segments subjected to lower rates decay more slowly and are GC-rich. Although we are unable to draw any conclusions about causal factors, the results support the hypothesis proposed by Khelifi etal.(2006) that the isochore structure has been reshaped over time. If rate variation were a determining factor, then the current isochore structure of mammalian genomes could result from the local differences in substitution rates. We predict that strand-symmetric portions of the human genome will stabilize at an average GC-content of 30\% (considerably less than the current 42\%), thus confirming that the human genome has not yet reached equilibrium.},

We compiled the gene expression, polymorphism, and divergence data from the public databases of the human genome. The ratios of nonsynonymous (A) to synonymous (S) substitutions in polymorphism and divergence in the human genome were strongly influenced by the expression pattern and breadth of genes and showed strong correlations. Among the tissues we analyzed, the brain-expressed genes have the smallest and the liver-expressed genes have the largest proportion of amino acid changes both in polymorphism and divergence. The analysis implies that negative selection is the primary factor affecting expression-dependent gene evolution and the prevalent but nonuniform distribution of slightly deleterious mutations in the genome. Although the genes under relaxed negative selection evolved faster than the other genes, these genes are even more liable to slightly deleterious mutations in the population. On the other hand, nonneutral mutations in the highly conservative genes, such as brain-expressed and housekeeping genes, are largely deleterious and eliminated before they enter the population. 10.1093/molbev/msm080},

Using base substitution rates in intronic regions as a calibrator for neutral change, we found a strong avoidance of synonymous substitutions that disrupt predicted exonic splicing enhancers or create predicted exonic splicing silencers. These results attest to the functionality of the hexameric motif set used and suggest that they are subject to purifying selection. We also found that synonymous substitutions in constitutive exon tend to create exonic splicing enhancers and to disrupt exonic splicing silencers, implying positive selection for these splicing promoting events. We present evidence that this positive selection is the result of splicing positive events compensating for splicing negative events as well as for mutations that weaken splice site sequences. Such compensatory events include non-synonymous mutations, synonymous mutations and mutations at splice sites. Compensation was also seen from the fact that orthologous exons tend to maintain the same number of predicted splicing motifs. Our data fit a splicing compensation model of exon evolution, in which selection for splicing positive mutations takes place to counter the effect of an ongoing splicing negative mutational process, with the exon as a whole being conserved as a unit of splicing. In the course of this analysis, we observed that synonymous positions in general are conserved relative to intronic sequences, suggesting that messenger RNA molecules are rich in sequence information for functions beyond protein coding and splicing 10.1101/gr.070268.107},

	abstract = {Although sequences containing regulatory elements located close to protein-coding genes are often only weakly conserved during evolution, comparisons of rodent genomes have implied that these sequences are subject to some selective constraints. Evolutionary conservation is particularly apparent upstream of coding sequences and in first introns, regions that are enriched for regulatory elements. By comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes, we show here that there is almost no evidence for conservation in these regions in hominids. Furthermore, we show that gene expression is diverging more rapidly in hominids than in murids per unit of neutral sequence divergence. By combining data on polymorphism levels in human noncoding DNA and the corresponding human-chimpanzee divergence, we show that the proportion of adaptive substitutions in these regions in hominids is very low. It therefore seems likely that the lack of conservation and increased rate of gene expression divergence are caused by a reduction in the effectiveness of natural selection against deleterious mutations because of the low effective population sizes of hominids. This has resulted in the accumulation of a large number of deleterious mutations in sequences containing gene control elements and hence a widespread degradation of the genome during the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.},

In a recent study, we have proposed a "tissue-driven" hypothesis stating that the stabilizing constraints on gene expression levels can be partitioned among tissues; tissues differ in their tolerance to gene expression variances; and the constraints on expression divergence is correlated with the constraints on sequence divergence. Here we further tested the "tissue-driven" hypothesis by sub-grouping genes into Gene Ontology (GO) categories. We examined the distribution of tissue expression distance of genes in the major GO categories in the tissues. We also examined the correlation between tissue expression distances and tissue sequence distances or tissue duplicate distances in the major GO categories. Our results have shown that the tissues-specific stabilizing constraints are generally not dominated by particular GO categories. It is also shown that sub-grouping genes into GO categories increased the sensitivity for detecting potential positive factors in expression divergence in the tissues.},

	abstract = {Rapid rates of evolution can signify either a lack of selective constraint and the consequent accumulation of neutral alleles, or positive Darwinian selection driving the fixation of advantageous alleles. Based on a comparison of 1,350 orthologous gene pairs from human and mouse, we show that the evolution of gene expression profiles is so rapid that it is comparable to that of paralogous gene pairs or randomly paired genes. The expression divergence in the entire set of orthologous pairs neither strongly correlates with sequence divergence, nor focuses in any particular tissue. Moreover, comparing tissue expressions across the orthologous gene pairs, we observe that any human tissue is more similar to any other human tissue examined than to its corresponding mouse tissue. Collectively, these results indicate that, while some differences in expression profiles may be due to adaptive evolution, the levels of divergence are mostly compatible with a neutral mode of evolution, in which a mutation for ectopic expression may rise to fixation by random drift without significantly affecting the fitness. A disturbing corollary of these findings is that knowledge of where the gene is expressed may not carry information about its function.},

The tissue selectivity would shed light on the potential physiological functions of these genes and provides an indispensable reference to compare against disease pathophysiology and to identify or validate tissue-specific drug targets. Here we describe a systematic computational and statistical approach to profile gene expression data to identify tissue-selective genes with the use of a more extensive data set and a well-established multiple-comparison procedure with error rate control. Expression data of 35,152 probe sets in 97 normal human tissue types were analyzed, and 3,919 genes were identified to be selective to one or a few tissue types.

	abstract = {It is often supposed that, except for tandem duplicates, genes are randomly distributed throughout the human genome. However, recent analyses suggest that when all the genes expressed in a given tissue (notably placenta and skeletal muscle) are examined, these genes do not map to random locations but instead resolve to clusters. We have asked three questions: (i) is this clustering true for most tissues, or are these the exceptions; (ii) is any clustering simply the result of the expression of tandem duplicates and (iii) how, if at all, does this relate to the observed clustering of genes with high expression rates? We provide a unified model of gene clustering that explains the previous observations. We examined Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) data for 14 tissues and found significant clustering, in each tissue, that persists even after the removal of tandem duplicates. We confirmed clustering by analysis of independent expressed-sequence tag (EST) data. We then tested the possibility that the human genome is organized into subregions, each specializing in genes needed in a given tissue. By comparing genes expressed in different tissues, we show that this is not the case: those genes that seem to be tissue-specific in their expression do not, as a rule, cluster. We report that genes that are expressed in most tissues (housekeeping genes) show strong clustering. In addition, we show that the apparent clustering of genes with high expression rates is a consequence of the clustering of housekeeping genes.},

	abstract = {The analysis of evolutionary rates is a popular approach to characterizing the effect of natural selection at the molecular level. Sequences contributing to species adaptation are expected to evolve faster than nonfunctional sequences because favourable mutations have a higher fixation probability than neutral ones. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gene. Several criteria can discriminate between the natural selection and biased gene conversion models. These criteria suggest that the recently reported human accelerated regions are most likely the result of biased gene conversion. We argue that these regions, far from contributing to human adaptation, might represent the Achilles' heel of our genome.},

From whole-genome sequence alignments, 344 large (>100-kb) blocks of conserved synteny are evident, but these are further fragmented by smaller-scale evolutionary events. Excluding transposon insertions, on average in each megabase of genomic alignment we observe two inversions, 17 duplications (five tandem or nearly tandem), seven transpositions, and 200 deletions of 100 bases or more. This includes 160 inversions and 75 duplications or transpositions of length >100 kb. The frequencies of these smaller events are not substantially higher in finished portions in the assembly. Many of the smaller transpositions are processed pseudogenes; we define a "syntenic" subset of the alignments that excludes these and other small-scale transpositions. These alignments provide evidence that approximately 2\% of the genes in the human/mouse common ancestor have been deleted or partially deleted in the mouse. There also appears to be slightly less nontransposon-induced genome duplication in the mouse than in the human lineage. Although some of the events we detect are possibly due to misassemblies or missing data in the current genome sequence or to the limitations of our methods, most are likely to represent genuine evolutionary events. To make these observations, we developed new alignment techniques that can handle large gaps in a robust fashion and discriminate between orthologous and paralogous alignments.},

We have used denaturing high performance liquid chromatography to screen the first 500 bp of the 5' flanking region of 170 opportunistically selected genes identified from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) for common polymorphisms. Using a screening set of 16 chromosomes, single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found in [~]35\% of genes.

The relative ability of each promoter haplotype to promote transcription of the luciferase gene was tested in each of three human cell lines (HEK293, JEG and TE671) using a co-transfected SEAP-CMV plasmid as a control.

With 30,969 well-defined TSSs from mouse and 26,341 from human, there are sufficient numbers to draw statistically meaningful conclusions and to consider differences between promoter types. Unlike previous smaller studies, we have considered the effects of insertions, deletions, and transposable elements as well as nucleotide substitutions. The rate of promoter evolution relative to that of control sequences has not been consistent between lineages nor within lineages over time. The most pronounced manifestation of this heterotachy is the increased rate of evolution in primate promoters. This increase is seen across different classes of mutation, including substitutions and micro-indel events. We investigated the relationship between promoter and coding sequence selective constraint and suggest that they are generally uncorrelated. This analysis also identified a small number of mouse promoters associated with the immune response that are under positive selection in rodents. We demonstrate significant differences in divergence between functional promoter categories and identify a category of promoters, not associated with conventional protein-coding genes, that has the highest rates of divergence across mammals. We find that evolutionary rates vary both on a fine scale within mammalian promoters and also between different functional classes of promoters. The discovery of heterotachy in promoter evolution, in particular the accelerated evolution of primate promoters, has important implications for our understanding of human evolution and for strategies to detect primate-specific regulatory elements.},

Although CAGE, various tagging technologies and tiling arrays show that most of the mammalian genome is transcribed, a large proportion of transcripts do not encode proteins and are either poorly polyadenylated, involved in sense-antisense pairs or never leave the nucleus. In this article, I review the various techniques and data sets that are currently used to measure gene transcription and the evidence that reveals the true extent of transcription in mammalian genomes. The next few years will see efforts to identify novel transcripts systematically and decipher their function. A deeper understanding of transcriptional complexity might even lead us to redefine what we mean by the term 'gene'.},

Most studies tacitly equate homology of functional elements with sequence homology. This assumption is violated by the phenomenon of turnover, in which functionally equivalent elements reside at locations that are nonorthologous at the sequence level. Turnover has been demonstrated previously for transcriptionfactor-binding sites. Here, we show that transcription start sites of equivalent genes do not always reside at equivalent locations in the human and mouse genomes. We also identify two types of partial turnover, illustrating evolutionary pathways that could lead to complete turnover. These findings suggest that the signals encoding transcription start sites are highly flexible and evolvable, and have cautionary implications for the use of sequence-level conservation to detect gene regulatory elements.},

	abstract = {Markov models for protein sequence evolution were introduced 30 years ago. However, although Markov models are widely used in database searches, alignment programs, phylogeny and recently in comparative genomics, their properties are seldom investigated. This thesis presents new tools to to analyse Markov models as well as new models. I develop a method called almost invariant sets (AIS) which summarises the information given in Markov models by identifying subgroups of residues with high probability of change amongst residues of the same group but small probability of change between groups. Protein evolution can be modelled on the amino acid and the codon level. I present a model called an aggregated Markov process which combines both levels and allows the study of their relationship. The aggregated Markov process can explain some of the non-Markovian behaviour observed in the literature, and it suggests that protein evolution should be modelled with codon-level rather than amino acid substitution models. So far empirical models have only been formulated on the amino acid level. I have estimated empirical codon models using maximum likelihood techniques. Results indicate that modelling of the evolutionary process is improved by allowing for of single, double and triple nucleotide changes. A grouping of the 61 sense codons into subsets using the AIS algorithm shows that the aliation between a triplet of DNA and the amino acid it encodes is a main factor driving the process of codon evolution. Both factors, multiple nucleotide changes as well as the strong in uence of the genetic code and physico-chemical properties, are not part of standard mechanistic models, and this new view of how codon evolution proceeds leads to consequences for selection studies. An assessment of the accuracy of empirical codon models using likelihood ratio tests and a performance analysis in phylogenetic inference are accomplished.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The arrangement of regulatory motifs in gene promoters, or promoter architecture, is the result of mutation and selection processes that have operated over many millions of years. In mammals, tissue-specific transcriptional regulation is related to the presence of specific protein-interacting DNA motifs in gene promoters. However, little is known about the relative location and spacing of these motifs. To fill this gap, we have performed a systematic search for motifs that show significant bias at specific promoter locations in a large collection of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes.RESULTS:We observe that promoters driving housekeeping gene expression are enriched in particular motifs with strong positional bias, such as YY1, which are of little relevance in promoters driving tissue-specific expression. We also identify a large number of motifs that show positional bias in genes expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner. They include well-known tissue-specific motifs, such as HNF1 and HNF4 motifs in liver, kidney and small intestine, or RFX motifs in testis, as well as many potentially novel regulatory motifs. Based on this analysis, we provide predictions for 559 tissue-specific motifs in mouse gene promoters.CONCLUSION:The study shows that motif positional bias is an important feature of mammalian proximal promoters and that it affects both general and tissue-specific motifs. Motif positional constraints define very distinct promoter architectures depending on breadth of expression and type of tissue.},

	abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental process required for the expression of most metazoan genes. It is carried out by the spliceosome, which catalyzes the removal of noncoding intronic sequences to assemble exons into mature mRNAs prior to export and translation. Given the complexity of higher eukaryotic genes and the relatively low level of splice site conservation, the precision of the splicing machinery in recognizing and pairing splice sites is impressive. Introns ranging in size from <100 up to 100,000 bases are removed efficiently. At the same time, a large number of alternative splicing events are observed between different cell types, during development, or during other biological processes. This extensive alternative splicing implies a significant flexibility of the spliceosome to identify and process exons within a given pre-mRNA. To reach this flexibility, splice site selection in higher eukaryotes has evolved to depend on multiple parameters such as splice site strength, the presence or absence of splicing regulators, RNA secondary structures, the exon/intron architecture, and the process of pre-mRNA synthesis itself. The relative contributions of each of these parameters control how efficiently splice sites are recognized and flanking introns are removed. 10.1074/jbc.R700035200},

Thus, understanding the molecular basis of alternative splicing is essential for deciphering post-transcriptional control of the genome. Pre-mRNA splicing in general is catalyzed by a large dynamic macromolecular machine known as the spliceosome. Notably, the recognition of the intron substrate by spliceosomal components and the assembly of these components to form a catalytic spliceosome occur through a network of highly combinatorial molecular interactions. Many, if not all, of these interactions are subject to regulation, forming the basis of alternative splicing. This minireview focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the diversity of mechanisms by which the spliceosome can be regulated so as to achieve precise control of alternative splicing under a range of cellular conditions. 10.1074/jbc.R700031200},

	abstract = {The vast majority of human protein-coding genes are subject to alternative splicing, which allows the generation of more than one protein isoform from a single gene. Cells can change alternative splicing patterns in response to a signal, which creates protein variants with different biological properties. The selection of alternative splice sites is governed by the dynamic formation of protein complexes on the processed pre-mRNA. A unique set of these splicing regulatory proteins assembles on different pre-mRNAs, generating a "splicing" or "messenger ribonucleoprotein code" that determines exon recognition. By influencing protein/protein and protein/RNA interactions, reversible protein phosphorylation modulates the assembly of regulatory proteins on pre-mRNA and therefore contributes to the splicing code. Studies of the serine/arginine-rich protein class of regulators identified different kinases and protein phosphatase 1 as the molecules that control reversible phosphorylation, which controls not only splice site selection, but also the localization of serine/arginine-rich proteins and mRNA export. The involvement of protein phosphatase 1 explains why second messengers like cAMP and ceramide that control the activity of this phosphatase influence alternative splicing. The emerging mechanistic links between splicing regulatory proteins and known signal transduction pathways now allow in detail the understanding how cellular signals modulate gene expression by influencing alternative splicing. This knowledge can be applied to human diseases that are caused by the selection of wrong splice sites. 10.1074/jbc.R700034200},

The picture emerging from these pioneering studies is that alternative splicing affects most human genes and a significant fraction of the genes in other multicellular organisms, with the potential to greatly influence the evolution of complex genomes. A combinatorial code of regulatory signals and factors can deploy physiologically coherent programs of alternative splicing that are distinct from those regulated at other steps of gene expression.

The apo A-1 lipid-binding domain was used as a template for the synthesis of amphipathic helical proteins termed membrane scaffold proteins, employed to self-assemble soluble monodisperse discoidal particles called Nanodiscs. In these particles, membrane scaffold proteins surround a lipid bilayer in a beltlike fashion forming bilayer disks of discrete size and composition. Here we investigate the structure of Nanodiscs through molecular dynamics simulations in which Nanodiscs were built from scaffold proteins of various lengths. The simulations showed planar or deformed Nanodiscs depending on optimal length and alignment of the scaffold proteins. Based on mean surface area per lipid calculations, comparison of small-angle x-ray scattering curves, and the relatively planar shape of Nanodiscs made from truncated scaffold proteins, one can conclude that the first 17 to 18 residues of the 200-residue apo A-1 lipid-binding domain are not involved in formation of the protein "belts" surrounding the lipid bilayer. To determine whether the addition of an integral membrane protein has an effect on the overall structure of a Nanodisc, bacteriorhodopsin was embedded into a Nanodisc and simulated using molecular dynamics, revealing a planar disk with a slightly rectangular shape. 10.1529/biophysj.104.046896},

Different and stable equilibria were previously constructed by Salmon [J. Marine Res. 57 ; 503 (1999)]. The two sets of equilibria differ through a nonhydrodynamic or â€œghost\^{a}Â€? mode that has no direct effect on the hydrodynamic behavior derived in the slowly varying limit. However; Salmonâ€™s equilibria eliminate a coupling between hydrodynamic and ghost modes; one that leads to instability with a growth rate increasing with wave number. Previous work has usually assumed that truncated moment expansions lead to stable schemes. Such instabilities have implications for lattice Boltzmann equations that simulate other nonideal equations of state; or that simulate fully compressible; nonisothermal fluids using additional particles.},

	abstract = {Current models of codon substitution are formulated at the levels of nucleotide substitution and do not explicitly consider the separate effects of mutation and selection. They are thus incapable of inferring whether mutation or selection is responsible for evolution at silent sites. Here we implement a few population genetics models of codon substitution that explicitly consider mutation bias and natural selection at the DNA level. Selection on codon usage is modeled by introducing codon-fitness parameters, which, together with mutation-bias parameters, predict optimal codon frequencies for the gene. The selective pressure may be for translational efficiency and accuracy, or for fine-tuning translational kinetics to produce correct protein folding. We apply the models to compare mitochondrial and nuclear genes from several mammalian species. Model assumptions concerning codon usage are found to affect the estimation of sequence distances (such as the synonymous rate d(S), the nonsynonymous rate d(N), and the rate at the four-fold degenerate sites d(4)), as found in previous studies, but the new models produced very similar estimates to some old ones. We also develop a likelihood ratio test to test the null hypothesis that codon usage is due to mutation bias alone, not influenced by natural selection. Application of the test to the mammalian data led to rejection of the null hypothesis in most genes, suggesting that natural selection may be a driving force in the evolution of synonymous codon usage in mammals. Estimates of selection coefficients nevertheless suggest that selection on codon usage is weak and most mutations are nearly neutral. The sensitivity of the analysis on the assumed mutation model is discussed.},

Two aspects of the assumptions are evaluated. The first concerns the pattern of nucleotide substitution, including equilibrium base frequencies and the transition/transversion-rate ratio. The second concerns the variation of substitution rates over sites. The maximum-likelihood estimate of tree topology appears quite robust to both these aspects of the assumptions of the models, but evaluation of the reliability of the estimated tree by using simpler, less realistic models can be misleading. Branch lengths are underestimated when simpler models of substitution are used, but the underestimation caused by ignoring rate variation over nucleotide sites is much more serious. The goodness of fit of a model is reduced by ignoring spatial rate variation, but unrealistic assumptions about the pattern of nucleotide substitution can lead to an extraordinary reduction in the likelihood. It seems that evolutionary biologists can obtain accurate estimates of certain evolutionary parameters even with an incorrect phylogeny, while systematists cannot get the right tree with confidence even when a realistic, and more complex, model of evolution is assumed.},

The nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio ({omega} = [IMG]) is an important indicator of selective pressure at the protein level, with {omega} = 1 meaning neutral mutations, {omega} < 1 purifying selection, and {omega} > 1 diversifying positive selection. Amino acid sites in a protein are expected to be under different selective pressures and have different underlying {omega} ratios. We develop models that account for heterogeneous {omega} ratios among amino acid sites and apply them to phylogenetic analyses of protein-coding DNA sequences. These models are useful for testing for adaptive molecular evolution and identifying amino acid sites under diversifying selection. Ten data sets of genes from nuclear, mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the distributions of {omega} among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the selective pressure indicated by the {omega} ratio is found to be highly heterogeneous among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is detected in several genes in which the average {omega} ratio across sites is <1, but in which some sites are clearly under diversifying selection with {omega} > 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the {beta}-globin gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes from hominoids, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from human influenza virus A, and HIV-1 env, vif, and pol genes. Tests for the presence of positively selected sites and their subsequent identification appear quite robust to the specific distributional form assumed for {omega} and can be achieved using any of several models we implement.

Two of the more widely used models, the Dayhoff and JTT models, are estimated using similar methods that can utilize large numbers of sequences from many unrelated protein families but are somewhat unsatisfactory because they rely on assumptions that may lead to systematic error and discard a large amount of the information within the sequences. The alternative method of maximum-likelihood estimation may utilize the information in the sequence data more efficiently and suffers from no systematic error, but it has previously been applicable to relatively few sequences related by a single phylogenetic tree. Here, we combine the best attributes of these two methods using an approximate maximum-likelihood method. We implemented this approach to estimate a new model of amino acid replacement from a database of globular protein sequences comprising 3,905 amino acid sequences split into 182 protein families. While the new model has an overall structure similar to those of other commonly used models, there are significant differences. The new model outperforms the Dayhoff and JTT models with respect to maximum-likelihood values for a large majority of the protein families in our database. This suggests that it provides a better overall fit to the evolutionary process in globular proteins and may lead to more accurate phylogenetic tree estimates. Potentially, this matrix, and the methods used to generate it, may also be useful in other areas of research, such as biological sequence database searching, sequence alignment, and protein structure prediction, for which an accurate description of amino acid replacement is required.},

Analysis of a database of amino acid alignments shows that the description of the evolutionary process in a majority (approximately 70\% of 182 alignments) is significantly improved by use of the new method, and a variety of analyses indicate that parameter estimation with the new method is well-behaved. Improved evolutionary models increase our understanding of the process of molecular evolution and are often expected to lead to improved phylogenetic inferences, and so it seems justified to consider our new variants of existing standard models when performing evolutionary analyses of amino acid sequences.

We describe a model, denoted SDT, that allows for single-nucleotide, doublet, and triplet mutations. Applied to protein-coding DNA, the SDT model allows doublet and triplet mutations to overlap codon boundaries but still permits data to be analyzed using the simplifying assumption of independence of sites. We have implemented the SDT model for maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference and have applied it to an alignment of mammalian globin sequences and to 258 other protein-coding sequence alignments from the Pandit database. We find the SDT model's inclusion of doublet and triplet mutations to be overwhelmingly successful in giving statistically significant improvements in fit of model to data, indicating that larger-scale mutation events do occur. Distributions of inferred parameter values over all alignments analyzed suggest that these events are far more prevalent than previously thought. Detailed consideration of our results and the absence of any known mechanism causing three adjacent nucleotides to be substituted simultaneously, however, leads us to suggest that the actual evolutionary events occurring may include still-larger-scale events, such as gene conversion, inversion, or recombination, or a series of rapid compensatory changes.},

Such an unrealistically high penalty for insertions typically results in overmatching of sequences and an underestimation of the number of insertion events. We describe a modification of the traditional alignment algorithm that can distinguish insertion from deletion and avoid repeated penalization of insertions and illustrate this method with a pair hidden Markov model that uses an evolutionary scoring function. In comparison with a traditional progressive alignment method, our algorithm infers a greater number of insertion events and creates gaps that are phylogenetically consistent but spatially less concentrated.

Such "codon-position" models have been shown to explain the evolution of codon data better than homogenous models in previous studies. This paper examines the ways in which codon-position models outperform homogeneous models and characterizes the differences in estimates of model parameters across CPs. Using the PANDIT database of multiple species DNA sequence alignments, we quantify the differences in the evolutionary processes at the 3 CPs in a systematic and comprehensive manner, characterizing previously undescribed features of protein evolution. We relate our findings to the functional constraints imposed by the genetic code, protein function, and the types of mutation that cause synonymous and nonsynonymous codon changes. The results increase our understanding of selective constraints and could be incorporated into phylogenetic analyses or gene-finding techniques in the future.

Previous codon models assume that protein evolution proceeds only by successive single nucleotide substitutions, but our results indicate that model accuracy is significantly improved by incorporating instantaneous doublet and triplet changes. We also find that the affiliations between codons, the amino acid each encodes and the physicochemical properties of the amino acids are main factors driving the process of codon evolution. Neither multiple nucleotide changes nor the strong influence of the genetic code nor amino acids' physicochemical properties form a part of standard mechanistic models and their views of how codon evolution proceeds. We have implemented the ECM for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis, and an assessment of its ability to describe protein evolution shows that it consistently outperforms comparable mechanistic codon models. We point out the biological interpretation of our ECM and possible consequences for studies of selection. 10.1093/molbev/msm064},

	abstract = {Accurate phylogenetic inference is a topic of intensive research and debate and has been studied in response to many different factors: for example, differences in the method of reconstruction, the shape of the underlying tree, the substitution model, and varying quantities and types of data. Investigating whether the conditions used might lead to inaccurate inference has been attempted through elaborate data exploration but less attention has been given to creating a unified methodology to enable experimental designs in phylogenetic analysis to be improved and so avoid suboptimal conditions. Experimental design has been part of the field of statistics since the seminal work of Fisher in the early 20th century and a large body of literature exists on how to design optimum experiments. Here we investigate the use of the Fisher information matrix to decide between candidate positions for adding a taxon to a fixed topology, and introduce a parameter transformation that permits comparison of these different designs. This extension to Goldman (1998. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 265: 1779-1786) thus allows investigation of "where to add taxa" in a phylogeny. We compare three different measures of the total information for selecting the position to add a taxon to a tree. Our methods are illustrated by investigating the behavior of the three criteria when adding a branch to model trees, and by applying the different criteria to two biological examples: a simplified taxon-sampling problem in the balsaminoid Ericales and the phylogeny of seed plants.},

Precisely defining in terms of size and composition as well as mapping the isochores on human chromosomes have, however, remained largely unsolved problems. Here we used a very simple approach to segment the human chromosomes de novo, based on assessments of GC and its variation within and between adjacent regions. We obtain a complete coverage of the human genome (neglecting the remaining gaps) by [~]3200 isochores, which may be visualized as the ultimate chromosomal bands. Isochores visibly belong to five families characterized by different GC levels, as expected from previous investigations. Since we previously showed that isochores are tightly linked to basic biological properties such as gene density, replication timing, and recombination, the new level of detail provided by the isochore map will help the understanding of genome structure, function, and evolution. 10.1101/gr.4910606},

	abstract = {Compositional replication strand bias, commonly referred to as GC skew, is present in many genomes of prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses. Although cytosine deamination in ssDNA (resulting in C-->T changes on the leading strand) is often invoked as its major cause, the precise contributions of this and other substitution types are currently unknown. It is also unclear if the underlying mutational asymmetries are the same among taxa, are stable over time, or how closely the observed biases are to mutational equilibrium. We analyzed nearly neutral sites of seven taxa each with between three and six complete bacterial genomes, and inferred the substitution spectra of fourfold degenerate positions in nonhighly expressed genes. Using a bootstrap procedure, we extracted compositional biases associated with replication and identified the significant asymmetries. Although all taxa showed an overrepresentation of G relative to C on the leading strand (and imbalances between A and T), widely variable substitution asymmetries are noted. Surprisingly, all substitution types show significant asymmetry in at least one taxon, but none were universally biased in all taxa. Notably, in the two most biased genomes, A-->G, rather than C-->T, shapes the compositional bias. Given the variability in these biases, we propose that the process is multifactorial. Finally, we also find that most genomes are not at compositional equilibrium, and suggest that mutational-based heterotachy is deeply imprinted in the history of biological macromolecules. This shows that similar compositional biases associated with the same essential well-conserved process, replication, do not reflect similar mutational processes in different genomes, and that caution is required in inferring the roles of specific mutational biases on the basis of contemporary patterns of sequence composition.},

The origin of isochores is still controversial: various neutral and selectionist models have been proposed--and criticized--since the discovery of isochores in the 1970s. The availability of complete mammalian genomes has yielded new opportunities for addressing this question. In particular, it was recently proposed that (i) the isochore structure is declining in many mammalian groups, and that (ii) GC-content is influenced by local recombination rate, possibly via the mechanism of GC-biased gene conversion. In this article we review the existing support for these two hypotheses, and discuss how they can be combined to provide a new perspective on isochore evolution.},

However, the number of genes and the number of genomes included in these studies might not have given a reliable broad view of the trend in GC change in mammals. It is therefore worth exploiting this issue with a broader coverage of mammalian genomes using a reliable approach, the maximum likelihood approach. We have applied two maximum likelihood methods to infer the ancestral GC contents of 176 mammalian genes from representative eutherian species and at least one marsupial species. Except for a large GC decrease in marsupial genes, we found no general decreasing trend in GC content in GC-rich genes or in other genes among eutherian mammals; indeed, the GC content of GC-rich genes appears to have increased in recent times in some genomes, e.g., the rabbit. For the large GC decrease in marsupials, it could be mainly due to the great reduction in chromosome number, which could lead to a large reduction in recombination rate and thus also a large reduction in the rate of gene conversion. Since many eutherian mammals still maintain a fairly large number of chromosomes, it is unlikely that GC-rich isochores are vanishing in these mammals.},

The G+C content is the basic characteristic of isochores, but they have also been associated with many other biological properties. For instance, the genes are more compact and their density is highest in G+C rich isochores. Various ways of locating isochores in the human genome have been developed, but such methods use only the base composition of the DNA sequences. The present paper proposes a new method, based on a hidden Markov model, which takes into account several of the biological properties associated with the isochore structure of a genome. This method leads to good segmentation of the human genome into isochores, and also permits a new analysis of the known heterogeneity of G+C rich isochores: most (60\%) of the G+C poor genes embedded in G+C rich isochores have UTR sequences characteristic of G+C rich genes.

Isochores, i.e. stretches of DNA with a distinct sequence composition and thus a specific GC content, cause the chromosomal banding pattern. This fundamental level of genome organization is related to several functional features like the replication timing of a DNA sequence. GC richness of genomic regions generally corresponds to an early replication time during S phase. Recently, we demonstrated this interdependency on a molecular level for an abrupt transition from a GC-poor isochore to a GC-rich one in the NF1 gene region; this isochore boundary also separates late from early replicating chromatin. Now, we analyzed another genomic region containing four isochores separated by three sharp isochore transitions. Again, the GC-rich isochores were found to be replicating early, the GC-poor isochores late in S phase; one of the replication time zones was discovered to consist of one single replicon. At the boundaries between isochores, that all show no special sequence elements, the replication machinery stopped for several hours. Thus, our results emphasize the importance of isochores as functional genomic units, and of isochore transitions as genomic landmarks with a key function for chromosome organization and basic biological properties.},

The inverted repeat is asymmetrically placed between flanking direct repeats. This sequence was cloned into a modified chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene containing a -1 frameshift mutation. Duplication of the mutation insert restores the reading frame of the CAT gene resulting in a chloramphenicol resistant phenotype.

All classes of the mutations found in wild-type cells but not MMR(-) cells were strongly affected by the directionality of replication fork movement. It also appeared that the directionality of replication-fork movement governs the directionality of sequence substitution mutagenesis, which occurred in wild-type cells at a frequency comparable to base substitutions and single-base frameshift mutations. A very strong orientation-dependent hot-spot site for single-base frameshift mutations was discovered and demonstrated to be caused by the same process involved in sequence substitution mutagenesis. It is surprising that dnaE173, a potent mutator mutation specific for sequence substitution as well as single-base frameshift, did not enhance the frequency of the hot-spot frameshift mutation. Furthermore, the frequency of the hot-spot frameshift mutation was unchanged in the MMR(-) strain, whereas the mutHLS-dependent mismatch repair system efficiently suppressed the generation of single-base frameshift mutations. These results suggested that the hot-spot frameshift mutagenesis might be initiated at a particular location containing a DNA lesion, and thereby produce a premutagenic replication intermediate resistant to MMR. Significant numbers of spontaneous single-base frameshift mutations are probably caused by similar mechanisms.},

To analyze the effect of dosDNA elements on spontaneous mutagenesis, various mutational inserts containing inverted repeats or direct repeats were cloned in a plasmid containing a unidirectional origin of replication and a selectable marker for the mutation. This system allows for analysis of mutational events that are specific for the leading or lagging strands during DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Deletions between direct repeats, involving misalignment stabilized by DNA secondary structure, occurred preferentially on the lagging strand.

In a previous study, we characterized a spontaneous frameshift hotspot near a 17 bp quasipalindromic DNA sequence within the mutant chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene of plasmid pJT7. A one base-pair insertion hotspot, ectopically templated by misalignment mediated by palindromic complementarity, was shown to occur more frequently during synthesis of the leading than the lagging DNA strand. Here we analyze the misalignment mechanisms that can account for the DNA sequences of 123 additional spontaneous frameshift mutations (22 distinct genotypes) occurring in the same quasipalindromic DNA region in plasmids pJT7 and p7TJ (a pJT7 derivative with the CAT gene in the inverse orientation). Approximately 80\% of the small frameshift mutants in each plasmid are predicted by palindromic misalignments of the leading strand. Smaller numbers of mutations are consistent with other DNA misalignments, including those predicted by simple slippage of the nascent DNA strand on its template. The results show that remarkable changes in the mutation spectra of a reporter gene may not be revealed by measurements of mutation frequency.},

The predominant mutations are G:C-->A:T transitions, with 75\% of these occurring at 5'-CpG-3' sequences. This mutational bias is consistent with deamination-directed mutation at methylated cytosine bases. The second most common class of mutations is G:C-->T:A transversions. A significant clonal expansion of mutants was found in several animals, and this was used to make an approximate correction of the mutant frequency such that the most conservative estimate of mutation frequency is presented.

	abstract = {Genetic instability is promoted by unusual sequence arrangements and DNA structures. Hairpin DNA structures can form from palindromes and from triplet repeats, and they are also intermediates in V(D)J recombination. We have measured the genetic stability of a large palindrome which has the potential to form a one-stranded hairpin or a two-stranded cruciform structure and have analyzed recombinants at the molecular level. A palindrome of 15.3 kb introduced as a transgene was found to be transmitted at a normal Mendelian ratio in mice, in striking contrast to the profound instability of large palindromes in prokaryotic systems. In a significant number of progeny mice, however, the palindromic transgene is rearranged; between 15 and 56\% of progeny contain rearrangements. Rearrangements within the palindromic repeat occur both by illegitimate and homologous, reciprocal recombination. Gene conversion within the transgene locus, as quantitated by a novel sperm fluorescence assay, is also elevated. Illegitimate events often take the form of an asymmetric deletion that eliminates the central symmetry of the palindrome. Such asymmetric transgene deletions, including those that maintain one complete half of the palindromic repeat, are stabilized so that they cannot undergo further illegitimate rearrangements, and they also exhibit reduced levels of gene conversion. By contrast, transgene rearrangements that maintain the central symmetry continue to be unstable. Based on the observed events, we propose that one mechanism promoting the instability of the palindrome may involve breaks generated at the hairpin structure by a hairpin-nicking activity, as previously detected in somatic cells. Because mammalian cells are capable of efficiently repairing chromosome breaks through nonhomologous processes, the resealing of such breaks introduces a stabilizing asymmetry at the center of the palindrome. We propose that the ability of mammalian cells to eliminate the perfect symmetry in a palindromic sequence may be an important DNA repair pathway, with implications regarding the metabolism of palindromic repeats, the mutability of quasipalindromic triplet repeats, and the early steps in gene amplification events.},

	abstract = {Imperfect inverted repeats or quasipalindromes can undergo spontaneous, often complex mutational events that correct them to perfect palindromes. Two models that depend on the quasipalindrome providing a template for a specific mutational event have been described to explain this mutation: an intramolecular and an intermolecular strand switch model. A 17bp quasipalindrome containing a -1 deletion within the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene in plasmid pJT7 undergoes a spontaneous +1 frameshift mutation that creates a perfect inverted repeat and a Cm(r) phenotype. By analyzing this mutation frequency in two plasmids that contain the CAT gene in either orientation with respect to the origin of replication, we show that the specific frameshift occurs preferentially in the leading strand during DNA replication. Due to the availability and proximity of the lagging strand template as a single strand during replication of the quasipalindrome in the leading but not lagging strand, we suggest that the specificity for the leading strand correction is due to a leading strand specific intermolecular strand switch rather than an intramolecular strand switch. To test this hypothesis, we have designed a genetic selection to detect a leading strand intermolecular strand switch. This selection utilizes asymmetric quasipalindromes, one of which contains two central stop codons. When cloned into the CAT gene in pJT7, reversion to Cm(r) requires inversion of the stop codons and addition of a +1 frameshift to correct the reading frame. The inversion of the central stop codons, which is predicted by an intermolecular but not an intramolecular strand switch, occurs concomitant with the specific correction of the original 17 bp quasipalindrome. Inversion of an asymmetric center can also be demonstrated when not under selective pressure using a quasipalindrome lacking central stop codons. These results are consistent with the correction of a quasipalindrome occurring predominantly by an intermolecular strand switch during replication of the leading strand.},

Surprisingly, the product of this recombination is not that of simple inversion between the inverted repeats, but almost exclusively an unusual head-to-head dimer with complex DNA rearrangement. Moreover, this recombination is dramatically reduced by increasing the distance separating the repeats. These results can be readily explained by a model involving reciprocal switching of the leading and lagging strands of DNA replication within the inverted repeats, which leads to the formation of a Holliday junction.

Analysis of the mutation spectrum of a chromosomal gene is a valuable tool for assessing the contribution of these mechanisms to mutagenesis in the cell. We have studied the specificity of mutations induced by various mutagens in a cDNA hprt gene integrated in a chromosome of a mouse cell line. To understand the mechanisms underlying mammalian cell mutagenesis, we compiled a list of more than 250 sequenced hprt mutations that arose spontaneously or were induced by mutagens, and compared it with the published mutation data. There are at least two distinct processes of mutagenesis in eukaryotic cells: one is mispairing, while another is errors in translesion synthesis. The alkylating agent methylnitrosourea causes G:T mispairing; consequently, most mutations it induces are G to A transitions. The second process can occur spontaneously or be caused by exposure to X-rays, Trp-P2, a tryptophan pyrolysate, or acetylaminofluorene. A variety of premutagenic lesions are produced in DNA by these mutagens, but spectra of the mutations resemble each other, especially in the high frequency of deletions at the sites of short direct repeats. The slippage--misalignment mechanism accounted well for the greater part of the observed deletions. A similar spectrum of mutations was observed in the tumor suppressor gene APC from colorectal tumors; about 40\% are deletions at the sites of short repeats. These findings led us to propose that slippage--misalignment is an ubiquitous mechanism of mutagenesis and is responsible for a significant proportion of spontaneous mutations in mammalian cells.},

Deletion of these mutation inserts may be mediated by slipped misalignment during DNA replication. Symmetrical sequences, in which the same potential DNA structural misalignment can form in both the leading and lagging strands, exhibited an approximately twofold difference in the deletion frequencies upon reversal of the CAT gene. Sequences that contained an inverted repeat that was asymmetric with respect to flanking direct repeats were designed. With asymmetric mutation inserts, different misaligned structural intermediates could form in the leading and lagging strands, depending on the orientation of the insert and/or of the CAT gene.

The other evokes a "strand switch" during DNA synthesis which, in a manner unique to quasi-palindromic sequences, may be resolved to produce frameshift or base-substitution mutations, or both. It is the unique combination of symmetrical and asymmetrical elements of the quasi-palindromic sequence itself that provides the basis for both models. Through the mechanisms described, the symmetrical elements permit unusually paired DNA substrates, and the asymmetrical elements permit templated insertions, deletions, and base substitutions. The model predicts a class of mutations--simultaneously frameshifts and base substitutions--whose sequences can be predicted from a local quasi-palindromic sequence. This prediction appears to be met by a significant fraction (more than 15\%) of frameshift mutations in the iso-1-cytochrome c gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

While misaligned DNA intermediates that explain deletion termini occurring in repeated DNA sequences have been described, no explanations have been offered for deletion termini occurring in other sequences. The DNA secondary structures whose formation is mediated by palindromic sequences appear to explain many of these. In this paper, secondary-structure intermediates are described for a series of spontaneous deletions of known sequence in the lacl gene of Escherichia coli. The model is supported by its failure to predict structures that can juxtapose simulated deletion termini in the lacl gene. We have found a strong association between palindromic sequences and repeated sequences at lacl deletion termini that suggests the joint participation of repeated and palindromic DNA sequences in the formation of some deletions. Sequences of deletions in other organisms also suggest the participation of palindromic DNA sequences in the formation of deletions.},

Forty-seven initial mutation events were detected in the STRPs using DNA from transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, but less than half (39\%) could be verified using DNA from untransformed cells. None of the cases where three alleles were observed In a single Individual could be verified using DNA from untransformed cells. The average mutation rate for the chromosome 19 STRPs after correction for events which would not be detectable as Mendelian errors was 1.2 x 10-3 per locus per gamete per generation. This rate may have been Inflated by somatic as opposed to germline events. Observed mutation rates for individual STRPs ranged from 0 to 8 x 10-3. The average mutation rate for tetranucleotide STRPs was nearly four times higher than the average rate for dinucleotide STRPs. For determination of the mode of mutation, events Involving STRPs on other chromosomes were also examined.

Two general mechanisms are considered. One evokes the formation and processing of imperfect DNA secondary structures (hairpins) for the production of mutations. The other evokes a ``strand switch'' during DNA synthesis which, in a manner unique to quasi-palindromic sequences, may be resolved to produce frameshift or base-substitution mutations, or both. It is the unique combination of symmetrical and asymmetrical elements of the quasi-palindromic sequence itself that provides the basis for both models. Through the mechanisms described, the symmetrical elements permit unusually paired DNA substrates, and the asymmetrical elements permit templated insertions, deletions, and base substitutions. The model predicts a class of mutations--simultaneously frameshifts and base substitutions--whose sequences can be predicted from a local quasi-palindromic sequence. This prediction appears to be met by a significant fraction (more than 15\%) of frameshift mutations in the iso-1-cytochrome c gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that newly arisen duplicate gene pairs experience an altered selective regime that is often manifested as an increase in the rate of protein sequence evolution. Many details about the nature of the rate acceleration remain unknown, however, including its typical magnitude and duration, and whether it applies to both gene copies or just one. We provide initial answers to these questions by comparing the rate of protein sequence evolution among eight yeast species, between a large set of duplicate gene pairs that were created by a whole-genome duplication (WGD) and a set of genes that were returned to single-copy after this event. Importantly, we use a new method that takes into account the tendency for slowly evolving genes to be retained preferentially in duplicate. We show that, on average, proteins encoded by duplicate gene pairs evolved at least three times faster immediately after the WGD than single-copy genes to which they behave identically in non-WGD lineages. Although the high rate in duplicated genes subsequently declined rapidly, it has not yet returned to the typical rate for single-copy genes. In addition, we show that although duplicate gene pairs often have highly asymmetric rates of evolution, even the slower members of pairs show evidence of a burst of protein sequence evolution immediately after duplication. We discuss the contribution of neofunctionalization to duplicate gene preservation and propose that a form of subfunctionalization mediated by coding region activity-reducing mutations is likely to have played an important role.},

	abstract = {Introns are among the hallmarks of eukaryotic genes. Splicing of introns is directed by three main splicing signals: the 5' splice site (5'ss), the branch site (BS), and the polypyrimdine tract/3'splice site (PPT-3'ss). To study the evolution of these splicing signals, we have conducted a systematic comparative analysis of these signals in over 1.2 million introns from 22 eukaryotes. Our analyses suggest that all these signals have dramatically evolved: The PPT is weak among most fungi, intermediate in plants and protozoans, and strongest in metazoans. Within metazoans it shows a gradual strengthening from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. The 5'ss and the BS were found to be degenerate among most organisms, but highly conserved among some fungi. A maximum parsimony-based algorithm for reconstructing ancestral position-specific scoring matrices suggested that the ancestral 5'ss and BS were degenerate, as in metazoans. To shed light on the evolutionary variation in splicing signals, we have analyzed the evolutionary changes in the factors that bind these signals. Our analysis reveals coevolution of splicing signals and their corresponding splicing factors: The strength of the PPT is correlated to changes in key residues in its corresponding splicing factor U2AF2; limited correlation was found between changes in the 5'ss and U1 snRNA that binds it; but not between the BS and U2 snRNA. Thus, although the basic ability of eukaryotes to splice introns has remained conserved throughout evolution, the splicing signals and their corresponding splicing factors have considerably evolved, uniquely shaping the splicing mechanisms of different organisms.},

By using comparative genomics, we identify pairwise dependencies between 5'ss nucleotides as a conserved feature of the entire set of 5'ss. These dependencies are also conserved in human-mouse pairs of orthologous 5'ss. Many disease-associated 5'ss mutations disrupt these dependencies, as can some human SNPs that appear to alter splicing. The consistency of the evidence signifies the relevance of this approach and suggests that 5'ss SNPs play a role in complex diseases.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide detection of transcription start sites (TSSs) has revealed that RNA Polymerase II transcription initiates at millions of positions in mammalian genomes. Most core promoters do not have a single TSS, but an array of closely located TSSs with different rates of initiation. As a rule, genes have more than one such core promoter; however, defining the boundaries between core promoters is not trivial. These discoveries prompt a re-evaluation of our models for transcription initiation. We describe a new framework for understanding the organization of transcription initiation. We show that initiation events are clustered on the chromosomes at multiple scalesclusters within clustersindicating multiple regulatory processes. Within the smallest of such clusters, which can be interpreted as core promoters, the local DNA sequence predicts the relative transcription start usage of each nucleotide with a remarkable 91\% accuracy, implying the existence of a DNA code that determines TSS selection. Conversely, the total expression strength of such clusters is only partially determined by the local DNA sequence. Thus, the overall control of transcription can be understood as a combination of large- and small-scale effects; the selection of transcription start sites is largely governed by the local DNA sequence, whereas the transcriptional activity of a locus is regulated at a different level; it is affected by distal features or events such as enhancers and chromatin remodeling. 10.1101/gr.6831208},

	abstract = {Although the Human Genome Project was completed 4 years ago, the catalog of human protein-coding genes remains a matter of controversy. Current catalogs list a total of {approx}24,500 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly suspected that a large fraction of these entries are functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA transcripts, because they show no evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse or dog. However, there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFsspecifically, their properties in other primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the number of protein-coding genes to {approx}20,500. Specifically, it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been relatively little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding genes. 10.1073/pnas.0709013104},

@inproceedings{citeulike:1950521,
	abstract = {We examine the organizational impact on phylogenetic databases of the increasing sophistication in the need and use of phylogenetic data. A primary issue is the use of the unnormalized representation of phylogenies in Newick format as a primitive data type in existing phylogenetic databases. In particular we identify and enumerate a list of potential applications of such databases and queries (use-cases) that biologists may wish to see integrated into a phylogenetic database management system. We show there are many queries that would best be supported by a normalized data model where phylogenies are stored as lists of edges. Since many of the queries require transitive traversals of the phylogenies we demonstrate, constructively, that complex phylogenetic queries can be conveniently constructed as Datalog programs. We address concerns with respect to the cost and performance of the normalized representation by developing and empirically evaluating a feasibility prototype.},
